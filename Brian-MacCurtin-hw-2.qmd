For this assignment, we will be using the [Abalone dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of physical measurements of abalone (a type of marine snail) and includes information on the age, sex, and size of the abalone.

We will be using the following libraries:

```{r, message =FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(cowplot)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Question 1
::: {.callout-tip}
## 30 points
EDA using `readr`, `tidyr` and `ggplot2`
:::

###### 1.1 (5 points)

Load the "Abalone" dataset as a tibble called `abalone` using the URL provided below. The `abalone_col_names` variable contains a vector of the column names for this dataset (to be consistent with the R naming pattern). Make sure you read the dataset with the provided column names. 

```{r}
library(readr)
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data"

abalone_col_names <- c(
  "sex", 
  "length", 
  "diameter", 
  "height", 
  "whole_weight", 
  "shucked_weight", 
  "viscera_weight", 
  "shell_weight", 
  "rings"
)

abalone <- read.csv(url)
colnames(abalone) <- abalone_col_names
head(abalone)
```

---

###### 1.2 (5 points)

Remove missing values and `NA`s from the dataset and store the cleaned data in a tibble called `df`. How many rows were dropped?

```{r}
#Originally 4176 observations
df <- na.omit(abalone)
head(df)
```

0 rows were dropped. Still have 4176 observations


---

##### 1.3 (5 points)

Plot histograms of all the quantitative variables in a **single plot** [^footnote_facet_wrap]

```{r}
df %>%
  select(length, diameter, height, whole_weight, shucked_weight, viscera_weight, shell_weight, rings) %>%
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
  geom_histogram()
```

---

##### 1.4 (5 points)

Create a boxplot of `length` for each `sex` and create a violin-plot of of `diameter` for each `sex`. Are there any notable differences in the physical appearences of abalones based on your analysis here?

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x=sex, y=length)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Length")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x=sex, y=diameter)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Diameter")
```

We can clearly see that the lengths and diameters of infants are less than non infants. However, between males and females, there is no obvious differences in the lengths and diameters of the abalone. They have similar means and similar spreads

---

###### 1.5  (5 points)

Create a scatter plot of `length` and `diameter`, and modify the shape and color of the points based on the `sex` variable. Change the size of each point based on the `shell_wight` value for each observation. Are there any notable anomalies in the dataset?


```{r}
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x=length, y=diameter, color = sex, shape= sex, size = shell_weight)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

There is one infant who has about double the diameter of other abalones at the same length. Because of this, it also has a much bigger shell weight than other infant abalones at the same length. Otherwise, we can see that as the length of the abalone grows, the diameter and shell weight grow as well.

---

###### 1.6 (5 points)

For each `sex`, create separate scatter plots of `length` and `diameter`. For each plot, also add a **linear** trendline to illustrate the relationship between the variables. Use the `facet_wrap()` function in R for this, and ensure that the plots are vertically stacked **not** horizontally. You should end up with a plot that looks like this: [^footnote_plot_facet]


```{r}
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x=length, y=diameter)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  facet_wrap(~sex, dir = "v")
```

## Question 2
::: {.callout-tip}
## 40 points
More advanced analyses using `dplyr`, `purrrr` and `ggplot2`
:::


---

###### 2.1 (10 points)

Filter the data to only include abalone with a length of at least $0.5$ meters. Group the data by `sex` and calculate the mean of each variable for each group. Create a bar plot to visualize the mean values for each variable by `sex`.

```{r}
df4 <-
  df %>%
  filter(length >= .5) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(meanlength = mean(length),
            meandiameter = mean(diameter),
            meanheight = mean(height),
            meanwhole_weight = mean(whole_weight),
            meanshucked_weight = mean(shucked_weight),
            meanviscera_weight = mean(viscera_weight),
            meanshell_weight = mean(shell_weight),
            meanrings = mean(rings)) %>%
  pivot_longer(!sex,
               values_to = "Mean",
               names_to = "Variable") 

ggplot(data=df4, aes(x=Mean, y=Variable)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill=sex)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(sex), dir="v") 
```


---

###### 2.2 (15 points)

Implement the following in a **single command**:

1. Temporarily create a new variable called `num_rings` which takes a value of:

  * `"low"` if `rings < 10`
  * `"high"` if `rings > 20`, and
  * `"med"` otherwise

2. Group `df` by this new variable and `sex` and compute `avg_weight` as the average of the `whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight` for each combination of `num_rings` and `sex`. 

3. Use the `geom_tile()` function to create a tile plot of `num_rings` vs `sex` with the color indicating of each tile indicating the `avg_weight` value. 


```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(num_rings = ifelse(rings < 10, "low",
                            ifelse(rings > 20, "high", "med"))) %>%
  group_by(sex, num_rings) %>%
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=num_rings, y=sex, fill=avg_weight)) +
  geom_tile()

```


---

###### 2.3 (5 points)

Make a table of the pairwise correlations between all the numeric variables rounded to 2 decimal points. Your final answer should look like this [^footnote_table]


```{r}
df3 <-
  df %>%
  select(length, diameter, height, whole_weight, shucked_weight, viscera_weight, shell_weight, rings)


table <- round(cor(df3), 2)
table
```



---

###### 2.4 (10 points)

Use the `map2()` function from the `purrr` package to create a scatter plot for each _quantitative_ variable against the number of `rings` variable. Color the points based on the `sex` of each abalone. You can use the `cowplot::plot_grid()` function to finally make the following grid of plots.

:::{.content-visible when-format="html"}
![](images/plot_grid.png)
:::


```{r}
quant <- 
  abalone %>%
  select(length, diameter, height, whole_weight, shucked_weight, viscera_weight, shell_weight, rings) %>%
  map2(., names(.), ~ ggplot(abalone, aes(x = rings, y = ., color = sex)) + 
          geom_point() + 
          ggtitle(.y) +
          xlab("Rings"))

cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = quant, ncol = 3)
```

## Question 3
::: {.callout-tip}
## 30 points

Linear regression using `lm`
:::

---

###### 3.1 (10 points)

Perform a simple linear regression with `diameter` as the covariate and `height` as the response. Interpret the model coefficients and their significance values. 


```{r}
model <- lm(height ~ diameter, data = df)
summary(model)
```

The y-intercept, $\beta_0$ - The mean height of a hypothetical abalone is -.0037 mm when the diameter is 0 mm

The slope, $\beta_1$ - For each additional mm in diameter, we expect the height of an abalone to increase by .3513 mm

Since the p-value for the intercept is below the level of significance, this suggests that the intercept term is statistically different than zero

Since the p-value of diameter is below the level of significance, this suggests that diameter is a useful predictor when predicting height since the slope is statistically different than zero

---

###### 3.2 (10 points)

Make a scatterplot of `height` vs `diameter` and plot the regression line in `color="red"`. You can use the base `plot()` function in R for this. Is the linear model an appropriate fit for this relationship? Explain. 


```{r}
plot(df$diameter, df$height)
abline(model, col="red")
```

Yes a linear model seems appropriate. The regression line follows the trend of the data really well and there is no curvature to the points in the plot

---

###### 3.3  (10 points)

Suppose we have collected observations for "new" abalones with `new_diameter` values given below. What is the expected value of their `height` based on your model above? Plot these new observations along with your predictions in your plot from earlier using `color="violet"`

```{r}

new_diameters <- c(
  0.15218946,
  0.48361548,
  0.58095513,
  0.07603687,
  0.50234599,
  0.83462092,
  0.95681938,
  0.92906875,
  0.94245437,
  0.01209518
)


predicted_height <- predict(model, data.frame(diameter = new_diameters))
predicted_height

plot(df$diameter, df$height)
abline(model, col="red")
points(new_diameters, predicted_height, col = "violet")
```
