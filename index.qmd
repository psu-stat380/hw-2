For this assignment, we will be using the [Abalone
dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of physical
measurements of abalone (a type of marine snail) and includes
information on the age, sex, and size of the abalone.

We will be using the following libraries:

```{R}
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(cowplot)
```

## Question 1

::: callout-tip
## 30 points

EDA using `readr`, `tidyr` and `ggplot2`
:::

###### 1.1 (5 points)

Load the "Abalone" dataset as a tibble called `abalone` using the URL
provided below. The `abalone_col_names` variable contains a vector of
the column names for this dataset (to be consistent with the R naming
pattern). Make sure you read the dataset with the provided column names.

```{R}
library(readr)
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data"

abalone_col_names <- c(
  "sex", 
  "length", 
  "diameter", 
  "height", 
  "whole_weight", 
  "shucked_weight", 
  "viscera_weight", 
  "shell_weight", 
  "rings"
)

# reading in the url to create 'abalone' tibble
abalone <- read.csv(url)

# renaming columns in 'abalone' to col names provided
colnames(abalone) = abalone_col_names

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 1.2 (5 points)

Remove missing values and `NA`s from the dataset and store the cleaned
data in a tibble called `df`. How many rows were dropped?

```{R}
df <- abalone %>%
  na.omit()
```

No rows were dropped. The number of rows in 'df' is the same as
'abalone'. Also, per the website, the abalone has no missing data, so
thus, no rows should have been dropped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 1.3 (5 points)

Plot histograms of all the quantitative variables in a **single plot**
[^1]

[^1]: You can use the `facet_wrap()` function for this. Have a look at
    its documentation using the help console in R

```{R}
df %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x = sex))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 1.4 (5 points)

Create a boxplot of `length` for each `sex` and create a violin-plot of
of `diameter` for each `sex`. Are there any notable differences in the
physical appearences of abalones based on your analysis here?

```{R}
df %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = length, y = sex))
```

```{R}
df %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_violin(aes(x = diameter, y = sex)) 
```

Based on the boxplot and violin plot, the male and female abalones are
very similar in physical appearance as their distributions for length
and diameter were nearly identical. They had both had an average of
about 0.6 mm for their length and had the greatest density in diameter
at about 0.49 mm. However, the miniumum and outlier lengths and
diameters of the female abalones were much smaller than that of the male
abalones. For the infant abalones, as expected, their lengths and
diameters are much smaller than the males and females. I was surprised
with how close the maximum length for the infant abalones was to the
maximum lengths.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 1.5 (5 points)

Create a scatter plot of `length` and `diameter`, and modify the shape
and color of the points based on the `sex` variable. Change the size of
each point based on the `shell_wight` value for each observation. Are
there any notable anomalies in the dataset?

```{R}
df %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = length, y = diameter, shape = sex, color = sex, size = shell_weight))
```

There is one very noticeable anomaly in the data set. This occurs with
an infant abalone, in which its diameter is nearly two times its length,
which is very abnormal. Typically, infant abalones with a length of
about 0.2 mm, have a diameter of about 0.15 mm and a shell_weight that's
very small, in this case we will say 0.1 g. For this anomaly, it has a
length of about 0.2 mm, a diameter of about 0.38 mm and shell weight
around 0.25 g. ---

###### 1.6 (5 points)

For each `sex`, create separate scatter plots of `length` and
`diameter`. For each plot, also add a **linear** trendline to illustrate
the relationship between the variables. Use the `facet_wrap()` function
in R for this, and ensure that the plots are vertically stacked **not**
horizontally. You should end up with a plot that looks like this: [^2]

[^2]: Plot example for 1.6<br>
    [![](images/lines.png){style="height: 5em;"}]{.content-visible
    when-format="html"}

```{R}
df %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = length, y = diameter, color = sex)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = length, y = diameter), method = lm, color = 'black') +
  facet_wrap(~sex, nrow = 3)
```

## Question 2

## 40 points

More advanced analyses using `dplyr`, `purrrr` and `ggplot2`
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.1 (10 points)

Filter the data to only include abalone with a length of at least $0.5$
meters. Group the data by `sex` and calculate the mean of each variable
for each group. Create a bar plot to visualize the mean values for each
variable by `sex`.

``` r
df2 <- df %>% 
  filter(length >= 0.5) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(averages 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.2 (15 points)

Implement the following in a **single command**:

1.  Temporarily create a new variable called `num_rings` which takes a
    value of:

-   `"low"` if `rings < 10`
-   `"high"` if `rings > 20`, and
-   `"med"` otherwise

2.  Group `df` by this new variable and `sex` and compute `avg_weight`
    as the average of the
    `whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight` for
    each combination of `num_rings` and `sex`.

3.  Use the `geom_tile()` function to create a tile plot of `num_rings`
    vs `sex` with the color indicating of each tile indicating the
    `avg_weight` value.

``` {r}
df %>% 
  mutate(num_rings = ifelse(rings>20, 'high', ifelse(rings<10, 'low', 'med'))) %>%
  group_by(num_rings, sex) %>%
  summarise(avg_weight = mean(whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight)) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_tile(aes(x = num_rings, y = sex, fill = avg_weight)) + 
  xlab("Number of rings") + 
  labs(fill = 'Average Weight') + 
  ggtitle('Number of Rings vs Sex')
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.3 (5 points)

Make a table of the pairwise correlations between all the numeric
variables rounded to 2 decimal points. Your final answer should look
like this [^3]

[^3]: Table for 2.3<br>

``` {r}
library(corrplot)

# selecting all columns in table except for the sex column
df2 <- df %>% 
  select(length, diameter, height, whole_weight, shucked_weight, viscera_weight, shell_weight, rings)

# getting all the correlation values for each pair of quantitative variables & displaying that table
data.cor <- round(cor(df2),2)
data.cor

# creating a shaded plot that shows the correlation between each quantitative variable
corrplot(data.cor, method = 'shade', is.corr = FALSE, col.lim = c(0,1), title = 'Pairwise Correlation Table of Quantitative Variables')

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.4 (10 points)

Use the `map2()` function from the `purrr` package to create a scatter
plot for each *quantitative* variable against the number of `rings`
variable. Color the points based on the `sex` of each abalone. You can
use the `cowplot::plot_grid()` function to finally make the following
grid of plots.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
![](images/plot_grid.png)
:::

``` r
dfrings <- df %>%
  select(rings)

df3 <- df %>%
  select(length, height, diameter, whole_weight, shucked_weight, viscera_weight, shell_weight, rings)

cowplot::plot_grid(map2(dfrings, df3, df3 ~ dfrings))

```

## Question 3

::: callout-tip
## 30 points

Linear regression using `lm`
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.1 (10 points)

Perform a simple linear regression with `diameter` as the covariate and
`height` as the response. Interpret the model coefficients and their
significance values.

```{R}
x <- df$diameter
y <- df$height

model <- lm(y ~ x, df)
summary(model)
```

The intercept coefficient is -0.003784. This means that a 'hypothetical'
abalone with diameter of 0 mm will have a length of -0.00378 mm.
Obviously this isn't possible, but it shows that the intercept of the
regression line is -0.003784 mm. The diameter coefficient is the slope
and is equal to 0.351346, which means that for every increase in
diameter by 1 mm, then the length will increase by 0.351346 mm. The
significance value for the intercept ($\beta_0$) is somewhat high at
0.0124, so that $p$-value has some significant. The diameter $p$-value
is very small, indicating that it is very significant. This tells us to
accept the alternate hypothesis against the null hypothesis, meaning
that diameter is a good predictor of length.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.2 (10 points)

Make a scatterplot of `height` vs `diameter` and plot the regression
line in `color="red"`. You can use the base `plot()` function in R for
this. Is the linear model an appropriate fit for this relationship?
Explain.

```{R}
x <- df$diameter
y <- df$height

plot(x, y, xlab = 'diameter', ylab = 'height', pch=20, main = 'Abalone ring diameter vs height', col = 'grey')
lines(x, fitted(lm(y ~x), color = 'red'))

```
This linear model seems to be an pretty appropriate fit for this relationship.
The regression line does a good job reducing potential error from the points by 
passing through the middle section of the chunks of points. There are few outliers
in the data set that may impact the $R^2$ value because of how far from the 
regression line they are. Despite this, the linear model is an appropriate 
representation and predictor of the data for this relationship.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.3 (10 points)

Suppose we have collected observations for "new" abalones with
`new_diameter` values given below. What is the expected value of their
`height` based on your model above? Plot these new observations along
with your predictions in your plot from earlier using `color="violet"`

```r
new_diameters <- c(
  0.15218946,
  0.48361548,
  0.58095513,
  0.07603687,
  0.50234599,
  0.83462092,
  0.95681938,
  0.92906875,
  0.94245437,
  0.01209518
)
new_diameters <- data.frame(new_diameters)
typeof(new_diameters)
new_height <- predict(lm(new_height ~ new_diameters),newdata = new_diameters)
new_height

plot(x, y, xlab = 'diameter', ylab = 'height', pch=20, main = 'Abalone ring diameter vs height', col = 'grey')
lines(x, fitted(lm(y~x), color = 'red'))
points(new_diameters, new_height, col = 'violet')
```
