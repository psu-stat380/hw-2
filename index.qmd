For this assignment, we will be using the [Abalone
dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of physical
measurements of abalone (a type of marine snail) and includes
information on the age, sex, and size of the abalone.

We will be using the following libraries:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(cowplot)
```

## Question 1

::: callout-tip
## 30 points

EDA using `readr`, `tidyr` and `ggplot2`
:::

###### 1.1 (5 points)

Load the "Abalone" dataset as a tibble called `abalone` using the URL
provided below. The `abalone_col_names` variable contains a vector of
the column names for this dataset (to be consistent with the R naming
pattern). Make sure you read the dataset with the provided column names.

```{r}
library(readr)
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data"

abalone_col_names <- c(
  "sex", 
  "length", 
  "diameter", 
  "height", 
  "whole_weight", 
  "shucked_weight", 
  "viscera_weight", 
  "shell_weight", 
  "rings"
)

abalone <- read_csv(url,col_names = abalone_col_names)
#summary(abalone)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 1.2 (5 points)

Remove missing values and `NA`s from the dataset and store the cleaned
data in a tibble called `df`. How many rows were dropped?

```{r}
#df <- abalone %>% drop_na()
#df

df <- abalone %>% drop_na()

dropped_rows <- nrow(abalone) - nrow(df)
dropped_rows
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 1.3 (5 points)

Plot histograms of all the quantitative variables in a **single plot**
[^1]

[^1]: You can use the `facet_wrap()` function for this. Have a look at
    its documentation using the help console in R

```{r}
df %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 1.4 (5 points)

Create a boxplot of `length` for each `sex` and create a violin-plot of
of `diameter` for each `sex`. Are there any notable differences in the
physical appearences of abalones based on your analysis here?

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = sex, y = length)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Length") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Length by Sex")


ggplot(df, aes(x = sex, y = diameter)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Diameter") +
  ggtitle("Violin Plot of Diameter by Sex")

```

## The 'diameter' and 'length' between both genders are fairly similar.

###### 1.5 (5 points)

Create a scatter plot of `length` and `diameter`, and modify the shape
and color of the points based on the `sex` variable. Change the size of
each point based on the `shell_wight` value for each observation. Are
there any notable anomalies in the dataset?

```{R}
ggplot(df, aes(x = length, y = diameter, shape = sex, color = sex, size = shell_weight)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Length and Diameter by Sex and Shell Weight",
       x = "Length", y = "Diameter")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 1.6 (5 points)

For each `sex`, create separate scatter plots of `length` and
`diameter`. For each plot, also add a **linear** trendline to illustrate
the relationship between the variables. Use the `facet_wrap()` function
in R for this, and ensure that the plots are vertically stacked **not**
horizontally. You should end up with a plot that looks like this: [^2]

[^2]: Plot example for 1.6<br>
    [![](images/lines.png){style="height: 5em;"}]{.content-visible
    when-format="html"}

```{r}
# Insert your code here
ggplot(df, aes(x = length, y = diameter, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Length and Diameter by Sex",
       x = "Length", y = "Diameter") +
  facet_wrap(~sex, nrow = 3) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Question 2

::: callout-tip
## 40 points

More advanced analyses using `dplyr`, `purrrr` and `ggplot2`
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.1 (10 points)

Filter the data to only include abalone with a length of at least $0.5$
meters. Group the data by `sex` and calculate the mean of each variable
for each group. Create a bar plot to visualize the mean values for each
variable by `sex`.

```{r}

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.2 (15 points)

Implement the following in a **single command**:

1.  Temporarily create a new variable called `num_rings` which takes a
    value of:

-   `"low"` if `rings < 10`
-   `"high"` if `rings > 20`, and
-   `"med"` otherwise

2.  Group `df` by this new variable and `sex` and compute `avg_weight`
    as the average of the
    `whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight` for
    each combination of `num_rings` and `sex`.

3.  Use the `geom_tile()` function to create a tile plot of `num_rings`
    vs `sex` with the color indicating of each tile indicating the
    `avg_weight` value.

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(num_rings = case_when(
    rings < 10 ~ "low",
    rings > 20 ~ "high",
    TRUE ~ "med"
  )) %>% 
  group_by(num_rings, sex) %>% 
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = num_rings, fill = avg_weight)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  labs(title = "Average Weight by Sex and Number of Rings")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.3 (5 points)

Make a table of the pairwise correlations between all the numeric
variables rounded to 2 decimal points. Your final answer should look
like this [^3]

[^3]: Table for 2.3<br>

```{r}

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.4 (10 points)

Use the `map2()` function from the `purrr` package to create a scatter
plot for each *quantitative* variable against the number of `rings`
variable. Color the points based on the `sex` of each abalone. You can
use the `cowplot::plot_grid()` function to finally make the following
grid of plots.

## Question 3

::: callout-tip
## 30 points

Linear regression using `lm`
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.1 (10 points)

Perform a simple linear regression with `diameter` as the covariate and
`height` as the response. Interpret the model coefficients and their
significance values.

```{R}
fit <- lm(height ~ diameter, data = df)
summary(fit)
```

The intercept is 0.0211, which means that the predicted height when the
diameter is 0 is 0.0211 units. The slope coefficient for diameter is
0.4579, which means that for every one unit increase in diameter, the
predicted height increases by 0.4579 units, holding all other variables
constant. The p-value associated with the slope coefficient is very
small (\< 2e-16)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.2 (10 points)

Make a scatterplot of `height` vs `diameter` and plot the regression
line in `color="red"`. You can use the base `plot()` function in R for
this. Is the linear model an appropriate fit for this relationship?
Explain.

```{r}
model <- lm(height ~ diameter, data = df)

plot(df$diameter, df$height, xlab = "Diameter", ylab = "Height")

abline(model, col = "red")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.3 (10 points)

Suppose we have collected observations for "new" abalones with
`new_diameter` values given below. What is the expected value of their
`height` based on your model above? Plot these new observations along
with your predictions in your plot from earlier using `color="violet"`

```{r}

new_diameters <- c(
  0.15218946,
  0.48361548,
  0.58095513,
  0.07603687,
  0.50234599,
  0.83462092,
  0.95681938,
  0.92906875,
  0.94245437,
  0.01209518
)
